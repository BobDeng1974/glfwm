GLFWM
=====

GLFW Manager - A C++11 wrapper of GLFW with multi-threading support
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is meant to be used as a library.
It depends on [**GLFW**](http://www.glfw.org), which must be installed on the system.

### Features
* wrapping of GLFW window-related concepts
* multiple event handling through class derivation
* handling of the same event with multiple handlers
* handling of different events for different windows with the same handler
* multiple content drawing through class derivation
* drawing of the same content in multiple windows
* grouping of windows
* multi-threaded drawing through groups
* sending update notifications to any window from others
* update notifications to whole groups
* automatic control of the loop

### Compilation
To compile this software, import it in another software through cmake.
Supposing to have your software root cmake file at

`<path-to-your-software>/CMakeLists.txt`

add GLFWM as subdirectory to it:

`# uncomment the following line if you do NOT want multi-threading support
#SET(WITH_MULTITHREADING OFF CACHE BOOL "Build GLFWM with multithreading facilities (i.e. thread-safe) or not.")
ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(<path-to-glfwm> ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/glfwm)
...
TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ${GLFWM_INCLUDE_DIRS})
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(${PROJECT_NAME} ${GLFWM_LIBRARIES})``

Then it can be compiled with the commands:

`> cmake <path-to-your-software>
> make`

It has been tested on Mac OS X 10.9 - 10.10 - 10.11
